<h1>Dome</h1>

<img src="../images/thumbnails/dome.png" />

<p>Teams: Red Army, Wehrmacht<br />
Place: Reichstag, Berlin, Germany</p>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Dome is the a multiplayer map in Call of Duty: World at War. The map itself is situated atop the Reichstag. As the name suggests, the building that provides the setting for this map is large and domed. The map has several narrow passageways that are perfect for Boucing Betties. One of the outdoor spots has two different sections - a 2nd floor section and a ground floor section. The lower section is usually the best to use because most enemies will be watching the 2nd floor. The downside to the lower section is that it allows the player to be surprised by enemies that take a flanking route from the side path (the outdoor area farthest away from the dome). The 2nd floor section has two flanking routes (the ladder and a path that leads indoors), though these can be defended with Bouncing Betties. Try to avoid using Sniper scopes here.</p>

<h1>Tactics</h1>

<p>A method is to camp on the high level where the long iron beam leads up to with any type of Bolt-Action Rifle, Rifle or Machine Gun picking off helpless rushing enemies by using Bouncing Betty's or Satchel Charges.</p>

<p>Another method is to use a Shotgun. If you are using a double barreled shotgun the best perks for that are Primary Grenade x2 or Bazooka with Sleight Of Hand and Extreme Conditioning, also be sure to use the sawed-off barrel. Alternatively with a Trench Gun it is advised you to use Primary Grenade x2 or Bazooka with Double Tap and Steady Aim.</p>

<p>In Free for All mode, it is advised to use weapons with suppressors, due to Dome's small size. This will conceal you and the other players will not all outnumber you as quickly as they would if you did not use a suppressor. Camouflage and Dead Silence also work well in this respect.</p>

<p>Tip: If you jump into the pit in the middle of the map for the 1st time, you get the challenge "Sayonara," which is an easy 250 xp.</p>

<p>If the high building is swarmed with enemies its possible to find a pipe like object so the player can attack the enemies from behind.</p>

<h2>Team Positions</h2>

<p>The Dome is like an arena deathmatch area. There's no cover, no tactical standpoints, just intense fighting. A weapon with medium range is all you need. A sniper is too long ranged and can be flanked easily, a shotgun is too short ranged making it so that the user needs to find cover which the Dome doesn't have a lot of. The trench-like area of the below side makes it useful to be a shotgunner though. A whole team can be fighting with machine guns or submachine guns.</p>

<p>2 Submachine gunners: The 2 is here because two people would be fighting with SMG's. Both should use the the PPSh-41 as the high rate of fire and the large magazine size of the round drum is suitable to this map's terrain. Or more so, one person should use the MP40 and the other should use a PPSh-41.</p>

<p>Machine gunner: This person should use the MG42 or the Browning .30 Cal because of its high RoF and power, an FG42 CAN be used, but its higher RoF and small magazine will drive away many players. Recommended: MG42 w/ bipod, .357 Magnum, Bandolier, Sleight of Hand, Extreme Conditioning.</p>

<p>Other support: This person uses anything they can to win here. A light support weapon like the FG-42 or the STG-44 should be used. The STG is recommended as it can pick off helpless players from afar. Recommended: STG-44/w Aperture Sight, Tokarev TT-33, Bandolier, Stopping Power, &amp; Steady Aim.</p>
