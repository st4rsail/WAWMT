<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Asylum is a map in Call of Duty: World at War. It is a little like Showdown, but much more extensive. It is also something of a successor to Vacant  due to the long and sharp angled corridors and line of sight orientation as well as embellished on side passageways and many different routes, but it is a fairly average-small level. This is a good map for game matches with smaller groups of people, but can be played with larger groups as well. As the name states, this level appears to be a small Nazi Asylum based off a part of the mission Ring of Steel when Pvt. Petrenko  assaults the German asylum. This map usually focuses on close range shooting, due to the fact that there is not a lot of open space. Guns that work well here include the PPSh-41 (or all SMGs), the Type 99 machine gun, the MG42, and the Browning M1919, and some semi-automatic rifles. The shotguns can also be effective. Also Rifle Grenades work well here, but the player can risk getting blown up, or seriously hurt.</p>

<h1>Tactics</h1>

<h2>Game Mode</h2>

<p>Search &amp; Destroy: The objective that is near the destroyed low walls is usually contested. However, some people tend to go to here just to make a distraction, while their teammate goes to the other objective. This method is effective as there usually is only about 1-2 people guarding it. The rest are guarding the objective near the low walls. </p>

<h2>Fighting Style</h2>

<p>Run 'N Gunning: Many people tend to do this on this map. Seeing as how the map's battle areas are small, run and gunners do well in this map. They can catch the enemy off-guard quickly, and then kill them and their teammates quickly too.</p>

<h2>Weapon Choice</h2>

<p>Submachine gun: Many people use these because of the high power and light weight of it. Run and gunners and flankers usually use these weapons (the STG-44 is also used).</p>

<p>Machine Gun: Use these weapons for guarding a choke point. The power and rate of fire of the machine guns can keep the enemy in check at a choke point. If combined with Deep Impact, MGs are excellent for killing enemies who will tend to camp/find cover behind this level's many walls.</p>

<p>Rifle: Use these weapons for an accuracy and power. The people who use these on this map usually have quick fingers for others use automatic weapons, so only a quick finger can stand up to the weapons.</p>

<p>Shotgun: Seeing as how the halls are small, using a shotgun can be effective in this map. The enemy however, can also evade fire by just backing up. This usually works because of the long hallways, giving them a lot of time to kill retaliate. Juggernaut with this weapon choice can help ensure a kill.</p>

<p>Bolt-Action Rifle: These are best used when camping on the second floor overlooking the courtyard, and then sniping enemies who pass underneath, or used to pick off other enemy snipers from a safe distance. They can also be used at either end of the long hallways. Most enemies here will be using SMGs and will have too much recoil to shoot back effectively, but there is a high danger of being flanked from the sides or from behind, so a Bayonet, Bouncing Betties and/or a CQC secondary weapon is strongly advised.</p>
