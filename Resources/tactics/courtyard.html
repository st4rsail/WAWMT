<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Courtyard is an enclosed map, with many short corridors, small rooms and a lot of cover. Around the outside edges, the map is very open, with long sightlines, but these areas rarely have large firefights occuring as most players gravitate towards the centre.</p>

<p>The map features mainly close-medium range fights, as there are rarely long sightlines available. The raised grassy sections in the middle of the map can be accessed from several areas and are often used for flanking or surprising enemies.</p>
