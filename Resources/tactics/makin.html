<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Makin is a Japanese map in Call of Duty: World at War. It takes place on the coastal area of Makin Atoll. It is possible to find good cover here, but this map equally displays open areas, where the player can pose as an easy target if not fully aware of one's surroundings. This map is also fairly dark in contrast, so the atmosphere is usually that of stealth.</p>

<h1>Tactics</h1>

<p>This map is generally disliked for games of Search and Destroy, however using the right gun can make Search and Destroy here easy. Rifles can be used, but because of the fighting usually taking place in smaller areas, a submachine gun could probably be put to better use. While not commonly used, bolt action rifles, such as the Arisaka can work well here, assuming the player does not go into the more close-quarter areas of the map. Makin is usually liked for War, as there are many different ways to get at and cover the flags, and no flag is too in the open or too urban. This problem is present in many maps, such as Castle. A good strategy for War on this map is to have a Submachine Gun, such as a Type 100 with Sticky Grenades or Molotovs, especially for in the lower, more urban parts of the map. In Team Deathmatches, players will generally fight for the watch tower because it can be easily defended and is the highest sniping area in the map. However, the problem with this spot is that enemy players will usually do their best to kill the player(s) in the tower with grenades or by sniping from a lower altitude. Round houses should be careful treading into, as opponents can enter from multiple sides. A machine gun would be as effective as an SMG as most fights will take place on the beach, or the bridges. Most people will fight over the treehouse. One person should take an automatic weapon and stay in the area leading to the treehouse. Another person with a machine gun could be guarding the area where the enemies will try to take the treehouse by surprise, preferably, the ladder.</p>

<p>To one side of the map where the sea enters, people with LMGs hang round here because it is hard to see them. It is also useful in Search and Destroy because it is easy to flank the enemy.</p>

<p>There is also a glitch near the Marine Raiders start.</p>

<p>In the Wii version, there is a glitch directly above the Japanese spawn point (it allows one to get onto an otherwise inaccessible roof, as well as out-of-bounds; this has also made the map despised by some Wii players and loved by others). Note: If anyone using this glitch starts shooting and is exposed, it is possible to kill.</p>

<p>It is common to find players in the water, as others do not usually look there. Combined with the dark cover of the night, the sea is a pretty good hiding place. Dogs cannot enter the water so it's advised that when Dogs are unleashed, sprint into the sea, to catch the enemy or be protected.</p>

<p>On Domination, it is wise to go for B with an SMG or MG.</p>

<p>It is also worth noting that because of the water, Molotov Cocktails will be ineffective in many areas, making Sticky Grenades a much more reliable alternative.</p>

<p>During a game of War, where the very first flag is, there are holes on the top sides of the "interior" hut. Throwing Satchel Charges through these and detonating them is a very easy and powerful way to clear the room of enemy players.</p>
