<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Roundhouse is a multiplayer map in Call of Duty: World at War. It was released during the beta and carried on into the full game. It was the only map in the beta that had tanks, and thus it was one of the most played maps, and still is with the release of the game. Roundhouse is a fairly large and open map, however it has side passages and a round building in the middle. It is a very good level for both snipers and tanks. This map maybe considered an even match, even though the Soviet spawn gains a height advantage for sniping, a quick Wehrmacht  sniper may easily counter snipe any Soviet sniper due to the probability of a sniper going up there. Once a Wehrmacht sniper reaches the long catwalk, the Soviets will be under a lot of pressure. If the Soviets can control the catwalk long enough to do some damage, they may win the battle. Typical bottlenecking of the enemy team may occur near the wrecked train at the Soviet spawn point, as some players may be too scared that Wehrmacht snipers may pick them off if they reveal their position too quickly. Another choke point is at the Soviet building, both teams may be trapped there due to the numerous spawn points inside. The battle is usually decided from the battle of the two tanks, whoever wins the tank battle usually wins the game theoretically, but the Wehrmacht Panzer IV can be eliminated easily if fired upon from the top of the catwalks. A good spot to place bouncing betties is in the rubble of the roundhouse itself, as they are very well hidden.</p>
