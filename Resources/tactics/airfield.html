<p>Teams: Imperial Japanese Army, Marine Raiders<br />
Place: Peleliu Island, Palau<br />
Terrain: Sandy</p>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Airfield is a medium-sized multi-player level in Call of Duty: World at War. The large buildings in either corner are usually the locations of the fiercest fighting, especially the U shaped building as it is a relatively good sniper spot. There are some unusual pools of blood around the map, suggesting that there may have been Japanese executions.</p>

<p>Most combat here can be either mid to long-ranged on the large, open plains, or can be close range in the buildings. Most people use a submachine gun, rifle, and/or a bolt-action rifle. Machine guns are also not uncommon on this map. It is rare to see a shotgunner, but if there is one, then the player most likely will stay in one of the two buildings or flank in the underground tunnel.</p>

<h1>Tactics</h1>

<h2>Game Mode</h2>

<p>For Search and Destroy, both teams have a wide range of tactics that can be used to prevent the other team from winning. The attacking team should have at least 1 Sniper in the "Zombie House", covering the window in the room where Target B is in. The attacking team should use the tunnels to avoid being sniped as well. For the defending team, A good tactic is to set up Machine Guns with Bipods covering the 3 main doors that are used to enter Target B from the trenches, but they should have someone covering their back just in case someone gets behind the building. It is also good to have someone rush in to the trenches, cutting off any enemies who try to enter into the trenches via the tunnels.</p>

<p>Domination is another very balanced mode on Airfield. Flag A is at the bottom floor of the "Zombie House". Flag B is by the destroyed bunker at the southeast end of the map, near Target A for Search and Destroy, and Flag C is where Target B would be on Search and Destroy, on the bottom floor of the building near the trenches at the Northeast end of the map. Since these flags form a triangle shape, flags can change very quickly, but Airfield can become a stalemate if teams defend their Home Flags well enough, as there is often fierce rushing to Target B. Camouflage is a good perk for Domination here, as the north end of the map and the tunnels are good routes if you want to travel from A-C and vice versa, which enables for sneaky captures. </p>

<h2>Fighting Style</h2>

<p>Sniping: Sniping is a very common strategy on this map. There are many points where one can snipe with a lot of cover or a huge view of the field. Both beginning spawn points have an easily accessible sniping spot close to them. For the American spawn, the building closest to the spawn has a tower that a sniper can snipe from. However, this can be dangerous as some enemy snipers could have situated themselves before the player. On the Japanese spawn, the building closest to the spawn also has a sniping point, the stairs from the outside leading into the building, or the broken wall of the building. Be aware, however, that enemies can position themselves on the crashed plane wing in front of the broken wall. The enemies can be hard to find if they're hiding behind the wing, but the player has little cover from the wall.</p>

<p>Flanking: It is easy to flank enemy positions on this map because of the tunnels. They are accessible through to the other side without being seen from snipers. This would be helpful to take out any enemy snipers camping in one general location. If flanking, it is better if to use a silenced weapon. Be aware, however, that enemies might put Bouncing Betties inside the tunnels, and that can stop an advance completely. There are also other flanking paths, like if the enemy is on the northern side, the player can go through the southern path to flank them. It would be vice-versa if the enemy was on the southern side. </p>

<h2>Weapon Choice</h2>

<p>Submachine guns: Use these weapons for flanking and run and gunning tactics</p>

<p>Bolt Action Rifles: Use these weapons for sniping</p>

<p>Rifles: Use these weapons for a quick, accurate shot.</p>

<p>Machine gun: Use these weapons for taking out a big group of enemies.</p>

<p>Shotgun: Use these weapons for defending the buildings. It should also be noted that in objective-based games like War, Capture the Flag and Search and Destroy, shotguns are very good for defending said objectives.</p>
