<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Castle is a medium-sized multiplayer map on Call of Duty: World at War  located in Japan. It features a building that is somewhat of a shrine, as it is positioned next to an area containing statues of lions. It has a balcony area where players will usually use for its height advantage. It also has a tower, often used for sniping, but many players will throw grenades in the enclosed tower often killing the sniper or player. It also features many entrances to get into it, and becomes a great stronghold if the enemy team captures it. The secondary building (Dojo) is the largest one, containing an obviously partially destroyed tower that oftentimes players will ambush other players trying to get to the area, as well as snipers. There is a high "cliff" like area that many walls are at near the Marine start, providing great height advantage for a sniper and excellent cover to firing down upon players. Cherry blossoms also litter the fields where the Marine start is. Oftentimes the Dojo is the focal point of the battle, as majority of the players will seek its tower for the height advantage. It was available during the Call of Duty: World at War Beta and carried over into the full game.</p>

<p>Most combat here is at close range, with sub- and light machine guns usually fairing well. If you stay inside, a shotgun can prove extremely lethal. Sniping is possible, with two distinct sniping spots, the Dojo and Shrine, both entailing sniping through a window from the upper story of a building. However, the battle cycles around the map constantly, so it is not recommended to stay in one sniping spot too long.</p>

<p>Castle can provide intense combat in Team Deathmatch, and is also a good map for the War game variant.</p>

<h1>Tactics</h1>

<h2>Game Mode</h2>

<p>Search and Destroy: Rushing the enemy's spawn with a submachine gun can be a good tactic. When defending, head left at spawn, and follow the path up to their spawn taking out any in your way. Once there you should move back through the center of the map, hopefully flanking any enemies. Marine Raider players often attempt to throw a grenade at the left wall of the dojo for a kill.</p>

<p>War: If you are on the Imperial Army side, use a machine gun with a Bipod, preferably one with a slower rate of fire or a high magazine capacity, like the Browning M1919, and mount it on the wall as you walk in through the entrance by the Main Stairs flag, be aware of flanking enemies.On the other hand, if you are placed on the Marine Raider's side a good tactic good be to use a sniper rifle and pick off enemies near the window inside the building you are facing at the start of the game.</p>

<p>Team Deathmatch: Oftentimes the Marine and Japanese forces will engage in the outside fighting near the small bridge over small pond. Occasionally, players will be wading through the small pond, and as there are small "shooting holes" near the pond, it gives the player in the pond a great disadvantage of their position. Also new players often stay in the pond as it is the only location in the map, dogs cannot attack. </p>

<h2>Fighting Style</h2>

<p>Sniper: Go to the sniper tower near the long steps. Jump onto the ledge of the roof of the building, then jump to the top of the gate. Proceed walking across the top of the wall to the big building. That is a great sniping location, but not much cover is available. The two towers, the Dojo and Shrine, are frequent sniper spots and the Dojo area is almost always mined with Bouncing Bettys. Sniping along the large stone walls of the Marine spawn is not a bad spot either. Mainly highly trafficked spots: the open door area where the Shrine is, the Dojo area, and the stone staircase to get off of the pond are popular Betty areas. You can also snipe from where the Marine Raiders spawn, and snipe the people in the shrine, especially with Stopping Power, whereas you can shoot through the wood. Also, sniping in the room in the very south is a good way to clean up the house in the north that you can climp up with a ladder. </p>

<h2>Weapon Choice</h2>

<p>Bolt-Action Rifle: Use these weapons if you want to be a sniper. Sniping on this map is common, as it has points with great views of the map. Many snipers also tend to use the bolt-action rifles without the scope on this map for an increased close-ranged combat ability. Most snipers tend to also use the Bouncing Betty perk with this weapon choice.</p>

<p>Submachine Gun: Use these weapons if you want to be able to be in the front lines, or flank the enemy. These normally dominate the games on this map (Exception would be the STG-44, which is also common on this map). The size of the map makes the submachine gun's light weight effective. The user could run faster and for a longer period of time.</p>

<p>Shotguns: Use these weapons if you want to defend a building. The shotguns are very ineffective if you're going outside a building, so many players tend to use it while defending the Dojo. The Dojo has a small area, meaning that the shotguns would be effective in defending it.</p>
