<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Cliffside is a multiplayer map in Call of Duty: World at War. It is in a Pacific jungle setting and takes place on a Japanese cliffside next to the ocean. The level is fairly large and is conducive to snipers, as they can usually see from one end of the map to the other. However, the map has plenty of cover in the form of foliage, bunkers, and rocks.</p>

<p>Japanese snipers get an advantage on this level due to their far superior camouflage suits. They can easily blend in with many types of foliage throughout the level.</p>

<h1>Tactics</h1>

<h2>Game Mode</h2>

<p>War: If the player spawns on the Imperial Army side, there are many places he/she can snipe any early-game runners. The most used one is the platform the player first spawns on. Others include the bunker to the south of the spawn, and, if the player is fast enough, the north cliff. Those going to the flag are advised to go through the mausoleum by going through the south passage for the enemy snipers can easily get set up before one reaches the flag. If the player spawns on the American side, it is advised that he/she goes south, so that the mausoleum will block the player from snipers. Also, if the player goes through the mausoleum, he/she are able to go to the middle flag easily without having to go out into the open to get there. Snipers who spawn here can snipe from the ruins, or from the obstacles right to the east of the first flag. The tall shrubs can easily conceal the players position. </p>

<h2>Fighting Style</h2>

<p>Sniping: There are many places where one can settle down and snipe. The places are the bunker above the caves and other bunkers, the ruins, and above the waterfall. These all have there flaws though, the ruins have many passages, following a passage usually in return helps in finding a sniper looking the other way. If they player is playing with friends or a very tactical team, have one of them defend the sniper with a sub-machine gun or a rifle. The bunkers may seem protected but they are very vulnerable against a gun with a scope or a sight, since the views are very open. And if the player is storming a bunker, just come from the side that the sniper is not paying attention to if possible, chances are the sniper won't notice. The waterfall offers very little protection against any other fire. The downed plane near the Japanese spawn point is actually an excellent yet underused sniping position earlier on in the match, as the plane and the foliage will often prevent detection from enemy players. However, once the player is found, he/she won't have a good chance of escaping.</p>

<p>Run 'N Gun: Most people who run and gun usually use a submachine gun. They try to flank the snipers and/or anyone who is in their way by going either through the cliffside path, or the southern path. They barely ever go through the middle for snipers that are usually looking over the area. The run and gunners usually also get a lot of kills if they manage to flank out the snipers. Seeing as how the submachine gun is more effective at close range, the snipers are usually killed by the run and gunner. A run and gunner will be easily be stopped by putting a Bouncing Betty on the north cliffside and the southern passage. The run and gunners will usually not pay attention, and might get killed by the trap. If the run and gunner is not killed, then the person who put the trap will at least be noted of the person/people going through the passage, and the person will be more ready.</p>

<h2>Weapon Choice</h2>

<p>Bolt Action Rifle: Use these weapons if the player wishes to snipe.</p>

<p>Rifle: Use these weapons if the player wishes to have a higher rate of fire than a bolt action rifle, with a higher accuracy than the submachine guns.</p>

<p>Submachine Guns: Use these weapons with run and gun tactics. </p>

<h2>Team positions</h2>

<p>Cliffside demands more skill in teamwork than most of the other maps, if the team doesn't work together, then the team will probably lose. Use a long range weapon to pick off enemies. Always stick together and the team come on top. The sniper and the machine gunner could create a trap or chokehold along the middle or anywhere that has cover and can be surrounded on the map for example, the sniper could be on the side of the map where the artillery cannons are while the machine gunner can be in the bunker with the rifleman being in the shrine in the middle while the Medic stays with the machine gunner defending him in the bunker.</p>

<p>Sniper: Although it just said snipers don't get much success here, a really good sniper should be one here. Use a weapon that has high power and high accuracy, but it should able the sniper to not rely on his/her teammates too much for support. Rifleman: The rifleman shouldn't work near a sniper because they would both be vulnerable at close ranges.</p>

<p>Medic: As the name suggests, use a submachine gun, but get something with a good chance at medium range and a high magazine size with good power. But this person should also be a medic to the soldiers because the most important members on the squad here would be using second chance.</p>

<p>Support man: This person needs a lot of ammunition and superiority in both close and long range combat. This person needs a weapon that can give good suppressive firing volume, but can work alone or with squadmates.</p>

<h2>Tactical locations and weapon choices</h2>

<p>Near where the marines spawn at the beginning of a game in team deathmatch, there is sandbag cover. Most Wii players start racking up kills here by sniping the other side. Use any bolt action rifle or anything with a good sniping capability. The Japanese will never come over to this side because they know it spells danger. </p>

<p>In the cave entrance near the cliffside, there is a bunker above there that most people see as a key point as it has good sniping potential, but as the map gets older more people know that most snipers go there, so it isn't a potentially good area to stay in. This is a great area for machine gunners as most people expect a sniper. Type 99, Browning .30 Cal, MG42 are the best weapons to use here. However, due to the lack of a roof, it's very easy to be killed if someone gets a grenade in there. Across the waterfall, there is an uphill trench-like structure. This place has the height advantage and has passageways to all the most important paces in the map. But at the same time, this area will spell hell for people defending it. There are five ways to get here also. Unless playing team deathmatch or hardcore/core team-based games, ignore this area. Note: this area is significantly easier to defend in the Wii version, but at the same time hard because there are a limit of four players on each team. Use any MG with a high rate or fire, or a sniper rifle.</p>
