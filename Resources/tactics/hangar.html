<h1>Hangar</h1>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Hangar is a multiplayer map in Call of Duty: World at War. It is a medium-sized map, and is quite open. It is comparable in size, placement, hiding, and sniping ability to Call of Duty 4s map Vacant. As the name suggests, the map features an aircraft hangar in disrepair. This is a good map to make use of Shotguns and Submachine Guns.</p>

<h1>Tactics</h1>

<p>Take advantage of the open area. Have a gun that has good mobility and high damage. Mainly, a machine gun would do this with flying colors. SMGs at medium to close range work as well because the map is not very large.</p>

<p>Have a team and gang up on people; this is a useful tactic in all game types and maps, but this map is definitely a place to stick together. Often, a well oiled team can easily defend the hangar interior with ease, sporting one or two snipers near the fighter planes and other players defending the entrances with Bouncing Betties. Do not "blob" with the team, a.k.a. sticking in a large group of people, it is never known if an enemy is equipped with a Rifle Grenade which could mean a large kill streak for the opposite team. Try to spread out, but stay together. Try to not be a sniper unless the whole map is memerized. Due to the graphical limitations of the Wii, the Wii version will be a lot harder to play as a Marine as they are easily visible and the hangar is extremely dark. Every piece of cover on this map is penetrable. Try using a weapon with high penetration or use Deep Impact.</p>

<p>Bouncing Betties can be a thorn if placed correctly. Place it not too close but in the killing zone.</p>

<p>Both teams spawn quite close to each other in Team Deathmatch.</p>

<h2>Positions</h2>

<p>Teamwork is the only way to last in the game because enemies usually traffic the important areas. With that being said, the player shouldn't group together as many players will use the "noob tube" and kill an entire squad meaning an easy 40-100 points for the other team. A good tactic is to find another route around the map.</p>

<p>Player 1: The lead man. This person should carry a rifle or an automatic weapon as one should be holed up in the Garrison Hut. Use a weapon that trades stopping power for a high rate of fire. Recommended: Type 99 w/ Bipod, TT-33, Bandolier, Sleight of Hand, Extreme Conditioning.</p>

<p>Player 2: This person should camp in the darker areas around the inside of the hangar. This person should make sure their teammates have their backs covered in other places as the flash of one's weapon will attract enemies. Make sure this player is the person who picks off enemies trying to reach the officer's quarters. The storage will usually ensure victory. Recommended: Springfield w/ Sniper Scope, Colt M1911, Bandolier, Stopping Power, Dead Silence.</p>

<p>Player 3: The mobile person. This man should carry an SMG to ambush around the officer's quarters. This person should always have a cooked Frag ready to throw into the area. Along with this, they should get ready to face fierce close quarters fighting. Recommended: Thompson w/ Suppressor, Nambu, Bandolier, Double Tap, Deep Impact.</p>

<p>Player 4: This is the support man. This person should always carry a heavy weapon or a shotgun or SMG. A shotgun is usually not recommended here as a shotgun lacks the range to do enough damage to kill a target at the range of fighting in this map. Though, one can never know when a shotgun might come in handy. This person needs to conserve ammo as they need to last a long time in the battlefield. Recommended: FG-42 w/ Bipod, Trench Gun w/ Bayonet, Bandolier, Overkill, Steady Aim.</p>
